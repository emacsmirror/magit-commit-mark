- In development.

  - 2022/03/11:
    Font locking should only be applied to ``magit-log-mode`` (not other magit modes).

  - 2022/01/24:
    Add ``magit-commit-mark-sha1-length`` which allows for possible increases in the SHA1 length used by Magit
    that otherwise causes those SHA1's not to match previously stored revisions.

- Version 0.1 (2021-10-22)

  Initial release.
